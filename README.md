# deorum-legions-landing-page-01

  DEORUM LEGIONS™ is a Greco-Roman fantasy series of novels written by Josh Alicea. The intellectual property is owned by Owl Shogun Studios LLC. The purpose of this repository is to act as a landing page for prospective customers to learn about and further increase their interest in Deorum™. It is meant to hopefully facilitate their decision to eventually purchase a copy themselves by the end of the web experience.

  All artwork present was created by Josh Alicea.

  The exception is a Roman tiled mosaic sourced from wikicommons:
  
  //FILE PATH START//
  ./assets/images/other/mosaic-floor-panel-google-art-project.jpg
  //FILE PATH END//
  
   which itself is a 2D representation of a real-world mosaic on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Due to the nature of the work, it is considered public domain. It is nearly 2,000 years old after all. All other artwork and graphics were built or drawn by me (Josh Alicea).

  All conceptual and narrative elements regarding the story of DEORUM LEGIONS™ was created by me.
